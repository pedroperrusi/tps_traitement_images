%   Rout = resampleImageToNewSpatialRef(R_in,tform) takes a spatial
%   referencing object Rin and a geometric transformation tform. The
%   output Rout is a spatial referencing object. The world limits of Rout
%   are determined by forward mapping the world limits of Rin according to
%   tform. The ImageSize of Rout is determined by scaling Rin.ImageSize by
%   the scale factors in tform.
